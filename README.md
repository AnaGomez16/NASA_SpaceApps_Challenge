# FireGuardian - Fire and Natural Resource Monitoring Solution

![FireGuardian Logo]("./FG-logo-5.png)


## Description

FireGuardian is an application designed for firefighters and authorities responsible for the prevention and early detection of wildfires and other natural disasters. Our application leverages innovative technology and publicly available data to enhance the capability of local communities to report and monitor fires and distribute critical fire and weather data.

## Key Features

### Part 1: Real-Time Fire Detection

We utilize the powerful NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) functionality, which employs artificial intelligence to detect potential fires in real-time. When a potential fire is detected, an immediate alert is sent to firefighters and relevant authorities. Additionally, our application verifies the existence of the fire using the Flight Tracker, which monitors the location of aircraft flying over the area and provides real-time images to confirm the presence of the fire.

### Part 2: Fire Risk Heatmap

FireGuardian also provides a heatmap that utilizes historical fire data and climatic conditions to predict which areas are at higher risk of experiencing a fire in the future. We classify areas into three risk levels: low, medium, and high. This allows firefighters to conduct more detailed monitoring of high-risk areas and proactively take preventive measures. Furthermore, we install weather stations in high-risk areas to continuously monitor climatic conditions.

### Key Collaborator Alert

To facilitate a rapid response to fires, we equip individuals considered key in fire detection, such as forest rangers and farmers conducting controlled burns, with a special device featuring an alert button. This device sends an emergency signal to firefighters via satellite and provides precise geolocation information, even in areas with no signal coverage. This enables an immediate and accurate response to the fire's location.

## How FireGuardian Contributes

FireGuardian focuses on empowering local communities and firefighters with the necessary tools for more effective wildfire detection and response. By harnessing real-time fire detection technology and risk prediction, our application helps save lives and protect valuable natural resources.
